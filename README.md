## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to create accessible accordions that work with keyboard focus.

### Continued development

I wanted to try animating the accordion opening and closing, but I still don't know how to work with CSS transitions. That could be something to focus on learning next.

### Useful resources

- [Accessible Accordion by Aditus](https://www.aditus.io/patterns/accordion/) - This example served as the base structure and code for my accordion.
